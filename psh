=head1 NAME

psh - Perl Shell


=head1 SYNOPSIS

A fairly simple read-eval loop. The C<-w> flag and 'C<use strict>' are
not employed so that the user is not bound by their stipulations.
Setting C<$^W = 1> will turn on warnings, and calling 'C<use strict>'
will (almost) do the usual thing if called by the user (see LIMITATIONS,
below).


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each line of input is read and immediately evaluated.

Multiline input may be entered by starting with a line like C<E<lt>E<lt>XXX>,
followed by lines of input not having C<XXX> on a line by itself,
followed by such a line. If C<XXX> is not specified, then the first
blank line terminates the input.

An input line beginning with `!' will be given as a parameter to
the C<system()> Perl function.

An input line beginning with `.' followed by a space and a file name
will cause the contents of the specified file to be read in and
evaluated.

If C<$ENV{HOME}> is set, and the file C<$ENV{HOME}/.pshrc> is present,
it will be read in and evaluated before processing begins. If not,
but C<.pshrc> is present in the current directory, it will be
read and executed.


=head2 PROMPT STRINGS

Setting the variable C<$psh::prompt> to a string will cause that string
to be used as the prompt-string. Setting it to a subroutine reference
causes the result of running that subroutine to be used each time.
For example,

  $psh::prompt = sub { $i++; "psh [$i]\$ "; }

will cause the prompt to be C<psh [1]$> followed by C<psh [2]$>, and so on.

C<psh> uses some of the same ``prompting variables'' as C<bash>. They are
accessed by placing a backslash followed by the code in the prompt string,
either hard coded, or as returned by the prompt string function. The
variables supported are:

=over 4

=item d The date in ``Weekday Month Day'' format

=item h The hostname

=item n A carriage return and line feed

=item s The name of the shell

=item t The current time in HH:MM:SS format

=item u The username of the current user

=item w The current working directory

=item W The basename of the current working directory

=item # The command number of the current command

=item $ `#' if the effective UID is zero, else `$'

=back


=head1 LIMITATIONS

The loop inside C<psh> will clobber C<$1> and other variables because
it uses matches to implement some of its special functions.

Very little error checking is done.

The effect of `use foo' is not as expected. Such statements, when
sent to Perl's eval() function, cause eval() to return undef, which is
supposed to indicate an error. Simple detection of isolated use statements
could be hacked in, but it would not be general, and would therefore
be fragile.


=head1 OTHER PERL SHELLS

Larry Wall exhibits the simple Perl shell C<while (<>) { eval; print $@; }> on
page 161 of the Camel Book (2nd Edition).

Rich Graves E<lt>F<rcgraves@brandeis.edu>E<gt> posted a comment to the original
psh-0.001 announcement on C<http://freshmeat.net>, which contained this
gem that leverages the Perl debugger: C<perl -d -e 1>;


=head1 FILES

C<psh> - The Perl Shell executable script.

C<.pshrc> - The user's Perl Shell `profile'. May be in C<$HOME> or the
current directory.


=head1 AUTHOR

Gregor N. Purdy, E<lt>F<gregor@focusresearch.com>E<gt>


=head1 CREDITS

The following people made contributions to this project.

=over 4

=item ReadLine Support

Code examples showing how to apply the Term::ReadLine package were contributed
by Billy Naylor E<lt>F<billy.naylor@eu.net>E<gt> (in his C<pash.pl> program,
which is his own Perl shell).

=item Symbol Table Dumping

Billy Naylor E<lt>F<billy.naylor@eu.net>E<gt> also had an example of a symbol
table printing function that was used as the starting point for the C<psh>
function C<psh::symbols()>. The C<psh> version adds the ability to specify a
package name, and it also filters out some special variables. The implementation
technique is also different from Billy's.

=item Prompt String Variables

Matthew D. Allen E<lt>F<s2mdalle@titan.vcu.edu>E<gt> contributed an enhanced
prompt string handling routine that emulates the C<bash> prompt variables. This
was expanded into the form now present.

=item Typo Spotting

Allan Kelly E<lt>F<akelly@holyrood.ed.ac.uk>E<gt> found some problems with the
generated documentation.
