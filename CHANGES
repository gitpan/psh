------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes bugs, refactors the code, and adds the
following features:

  * Background process management much more like bash.

  * Perl code in addition to executables may be put in the
    background.

  * Pipelines.

  * Initial internationalization.

  * New built-ins: 'alias', 'export', 'setenv'.

  * A flexible set of evaluation strategies that can be
    selected or reordered by setting a configuration
    variable.

  * Prompt strings can have escapes like \07 (ASCII BEL) or
    \10 (ASCII LF).

  * avoided trying to save history if there wasn't even a
    ReadLine module

  * added $psh::debugging variable to hold the debugging
    state, so it can be turned on and off in a running psh

  * A $psh::echo variable to control whether perl results of
	evaluation are printed.

  * The which builtin now shows which strategy will apply to
	a given command line

  * Grab more input automatically if <<BLOCK appears
	anywhere on the line, or if the line ends with an open
	brace.

  * results of psh::which searches are hashed.

  * Thorough documentation of every user-accessible variable
	and function

0.00205
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Changed prompting to pass prompt string into iget(),
    which passes it on to Term::ReadLine::readline or
    prints it out if the ReadLine module is not available.
    Thanks to Sam Tregar and "tmb at lumo.com".

  * Changed history handling so that empty lines and those
    consisting of entirely whitespace are not recorded.

  * Fixed a couple of typos.

  * Changed the regular expression for "smart mode" to
    allow "vi +3 psh" in addition to "ls -l".

  * Now uses Getopt::Std for option processing.

  * Fixed the code that detects the presence of
    Term::ReadLine.

  * Made more use of debug mode to print out advisory
    information.

  * Use zero instead of undef to set Term::ReadLine::MinLine
    so that we don't get undef usage trouble in the guts of
    Term::ReadLine::Gnu.


------------------------------------------------------------
0.00204
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added a bunch of stuff to the TODO file.

  * Added parens around each part of the $interactive
    detection expression.

  * Prompt variables are now dealt with via %prompt_vars,
    which can be modified, so that custom prompt variables
    can be created.

  * Added %built_ins.


------------------------------------------------------------
0.00203
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed typo that caused a bug where prompt variable "$"
    didn't work. Thanks to John Labovitz.
