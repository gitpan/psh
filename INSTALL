REQUIREMENTS
------------

Currently, psh works on any modern Unix system with perl5.
It has been most extensively tested on GNU/Linux systems
with perl 5.005, and also works with perl 5.004. Earlier
versions of perl will probably cause psh to fail.

You may have success with psh on a Win32 system. However,
installation and usage is considerably more complicated, so
for now it is recommended only for developers.


INSTALLING psh
--------------

Follow the standard procedure (from the source directory):
	perl Makefile.PL
	make

As superuser (if required):
	make install

Copy pshrc to ~/.pshrc.


WITHOUT root ACCESS
-------------------

If you don't have root access you'll have to move the files
manually. You can make your own modules directory and put
something like alias perl="perl -I~/.pm" in your shell's
startup dotfile, and copy the modules there. Then copy psh
wherever you want it, such as ~/bin.


MAKING psh YOUR LOGIN SHELL
---------------------------

If you'd like to make psh your login shell, you'll need to
change your entry in /etc/passwd. Here's an example for a
Linux distribution with bash:
	chsh -s `which psh`
Depending on your setup, you may need to add the full path
to psh to another file, such as /etc/shells.

It's possible that if you don't have root access, your Unix
flavor won't allow you to change your login shell. You can
try to work around this by putting something like
	exec psh
in your shell's startup dotfile. Be careful that this file
isn't executed by a shebang (#!) invocation of the shell, or
shell scripts written for that shell may mysteriously fail.
